# Remova - Privacy Protection SaaS Platform

## Project Overview

Remova is a comprehensive privacy protection SaaS platform that helps users find and remove their exposed personal data from data brokers and the web. The platform integrates with the Optery API to provide automated scanning, removal requests, and ongoing monitoring services.

**Domain**: remova.io  
**Tagline**: "Sniffing Out Threats, Guarding Your Digital World"  
**Target Users**: Individuals and families concerned about their digital privacy and data exposure

## Completed Features

- **Monitoring & Alerts**: Notification preferences, delivery channels, alert history
- **Onboarding Wizard**: Multi-step intake process with progress indicators and autosave
- **Support Center**: Guided troubleshooters, FAQ section, contact form
- **Account Management**: Profile settings, subscription details, notification preferences

### ✅ Admin Dashboard
- System overview with API traffic metrics and error monitoring
- Event log with filtering, search, and anonymized user data
- Real-time system health indicators

### ✅ UI/UX Components
- **LiveBreachNews Component**: Auto-rotating RSS feed with accessibility controls
- **LoadingSkeleton Component**: Multiple skeleton types for different content areas
- **Navigation Components**: Public header and authenticated navigation with mobile support
- **Logo Component**: Reusable brand element with size variants

### ✅ Accessibility & Performance
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant color contrast ratios
- Keyboard navigation with proper focus management
- Screen reader compatibility with ARIA labels and live regions
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Loading states and skeleton screens for better perceived performance
- Reduced motion support for accessibility preferences

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: React Router DOM v7
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design system
- **State Management**: React Context API for authentication and global state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Notifications**: React Hot Toast for user feedback

### Architecture Decisions
- **Component Structure**: Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **File Organization**: Organized by feature type (pages, components, contexts, services)
- **Mock API Layer**: Comprehensive mock implementation of Optery API for development
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with strict type checking

### Security Considerations
- Frontend never communicates directly with third-party APIs
- All sensitive operations designed to be handled via secure backend
- No API keys or secrets exposed in browser code
- Request/response logging architecture planned for auditability

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd remova

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Development Commands
```bash
npm run dev      # Start development server
npm run build    # Build for production
npm run preview  # Preview production build
npm run lint     # Run ESLint
```

### Environment Setup
Currently using mock data and localStorage for development. No environment variables required for frontend-only development.

## Testing Status

### Manual Testing Completed
- ✅ All page navigation and routing
- ✅ Authentication flow (mock implementation)
- ✅ Onboarding wizard with form validation
- ✅ Dashboard data display and interactions
- ✅ Reports filtering and modal functionality
- ✅ Account settings and preferences
- ✅ Admin dashboard with mock data
- ✅ Responsive design across device sizes
- ✅ Accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen readers)

### Automated Testing
- ❌ No unit tests implemented yet
- ❌ No integration tests implemented yet
- ❌ No end-to-end tests implemented yet

## Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **Mock Data Only**: All API interactions are simulated with mock data
2. **No Persistent Storage**: User data stored in localStorage only
3. **No Real Authentication**: Authentication system is mocked for development
4. **No Payment Integration**: Subscription management is display-only
5. **Static RSS Feeds**: Live Breach News uses static mock data instead of real RSS feeds

### Minor UI Issues
- Some loading states could be more refined
- Mobile navigation could be optimized further
- Form validation messages could be more specific

### Performance Considerations
- Large mock data arrays could impact performance in production
- Image optimization needed for production deployment
- Bundle size optimization not yet implemented

## Documentation

### Code Documentation
- TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Component props documented with TypeScript
- Inline comments for complex logic

### API Documentation
- Mock Optery API service with comprehensive interface definitions
- Type definitions for all API responses and requests
- Service layer abstraction for easy real API integration

### Design Documentation
- Tailwind configuration with custom design tokens
- Component library with consistent styling patterns
- Accessibility guidelines followed throughout

## Next Steps

The application is ready for backend integration and production deployment. See ROADMAP.md for detailed next steps and implementation priorities.
